{"/":{"title":"SymSys","content":"# What is SymSys?\nWhen someone asks me what my major was, I tell them “Symbolic Systems”. The first question that they ask is, “Uhhh what’s that?”\n\nThis tiny site is my attempt to answer that question. \n\nThere is an official site explanation of Symbolic Systems as a study that helps people who seek to understand “systems that are built with symbols, like natural language, programming, languages, and formal logic; and systems that work with symbols, such as minds and brains, computers, networks, and complex social systems.” \n\nWhat that basically means is that we study many different fields and, equally importantly, how they intersect with each other. These fields span computer science, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, and more. \n\nIt’s like the pinnacle of the saying, “A jack of all trades is a master of none…but oftentimes better than a master of one!” \n\nMy main intent is to share knowledge from this major so it is easily accessible to the public. SymSys is especially cool to learn because I’ve noticed that it weights the importance of edges in a concept-based graph more highly than nodes, relative to other majors that focus on a single field of study. \n\nMy second reason (which is much more selfish) is so that I can remember what I even learned in the first place! I graduated about a year ago and my studies spanned so many disciplines that it’s hard to keep track of what is what and how is where. \n\nThis site will probably resonate with you if you're the kind of person who likes exploring many things at once, in parallel :-) \n\nWith all of that said, hope you have fun navigating this site. It’s graph-based with nodes and edges, kind of like a brain. \n\n# Sections so far\nIn reality, many of the courses span more than one discipline, but for now we’re breaking them down by field: \n\n- [Computer Science](notes/cs)\n- [Design](notes/design)\n- [Economics](notes/econ)\n- [Linguistics](notes/ling)\n- [Math/Logic](notes/math-logic)\n- [Neuroscience](notes/neuro)\n- [Probability](notes/prob)\n- [Philosophy](notes/phil)\n- [Psychology](notes/psych)\n- [Overview](notes/symsys)\n\nI am actively filling out more courses over time with priority of adding content quickly rather than perfectly, and also welcome other contributors to this site! Here’s the [repo](https://github.com/belindamo/symsys). \n\n---\n\nThe long-term plan is for every node in this graph to represent a concept rather than an entire discipline.
