# Scientific Method
-   [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon): His works are seen as contributing to the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) and remained influential through the later stages of the [scientific revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_revolution).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon#cite_note-7)
	-   Bacon has been called the father of [empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism).[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon#cite_note-8) He argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning) and careful observation of events in [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(philosophy)).
	-   Baconian method
-   Empiricism: a [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory) that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from [sensory experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism#cite_note-1)
	-   emphasizes the role of [empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence) in the formation of ideas, rather than [innate ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_idea) or [traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditions).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism#cite_note-2) However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sensory experiences.
	-   Historically, empiricism was associated with the "blank slate" concept (tabula rasa), according to which the human mind is "blank" at birth and develops its thoughts only through experience.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism#cite_note-4) 
	-   Empiricism in the [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science) emphasizes evidence, especially as discovered in [experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment). It is a fundamental part of the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on [a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_(philosophy)) reasoning, [intuition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge)), or [revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation).
